[GovData.de](https://www.govdata.de/) is the data portal for Germany. The federal, state and local governments can share their data. Although the "Open Data Act" makes it obligatory to share data, only about 52,000 data sets are online so far.

## Your Task
Create a small dashboard that shows how many data sets each federal ministry has made available on GovData. It should be easy to tell which ministries have provided the most data. States, municipalities and other institutions can be ignored.

GovData provides two APIs. Use either the [CKAN-API](https://www.govdata.de/ckan/api/3) [(docs)](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/api/) or the [SPARQL-API](https://www.govdata.de/web/guest/sparql-assistent) to solve this challenge. In 'departments.json' you will find all federal ministries and their subordinated agencies that have published data on GovData.

Use a non-proprietary tech stack of your choice and explain in a readme how to run your solution. Please email your solution to [challenge@tech4germany.org](mailto:challenge@tech4germany.org).

## Evaluation
Don't take more than 1-2 hours for this challenge. It is possible to get the full score within one hour. We want to see that you know how to use APIs in a resourceful way. You should be comfortable with your tools and able to write clean code. We expect you to be able to reflect and justify your approach. We will not evaluate the UI.

## Have fun! 🚀
We look forward to your submission!
